# Pride's Exploding Kittens
Digital version of Elan Lee, Matthew Inman and Shane Small's card game "Exploding Kittens"

[!NOTE](In no affiliation with the actual game. This is just a fun personal project.)

*Initially probably a CLI game. I'm lazy. We'll see if I'll get into doing an actual executable with designs from the card game.*
